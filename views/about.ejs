      <h1>About WTest-Platform (WTP)</h1>
      <div>
        <br>
        <h2>WTP is a new kind of assessment platform</h2>
        <p>The principle is simple, the aim of this platform is to publish tests whatever technology is used. It presents all tests as a static website under security access.</p> 
        <p>Whatever if the test is based on QTI1, QTI2, QTI2.1, QTI2.2, QTI3, or anykind of code you use, upload it on WTP.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Workflow</h2>
        <p>This define the workflow :</p>
        <ul class="aboutUl">
          <li>Create your items and tests in your own environment as usual, export the test as a package.</li>
          <li>Import the zip package in WTP, the platform will integrate them in a static structure</li>
          <li>Import your target group of students using a CSV including their credentials (for the moment, coming : LDAP,activeDirectory)</li>
          <li>Create a publication that link the chosen test and the target group.</li>
          <li>Send a mail to your student saying go to this platform URL, identify yourself with your login and password</li>
          <li>The students pass the test and generate their results</li>
          <li>Follow the progression of the assessment on the platform</li>
          <li>You will receive a mail when the test-time is over or all students have passed the test</li>
          <li>Download the results</li>
          <br>
        </ul> 
        <h2>Versatility</h2>
        <ul class="aboutUl">
          <li>High stakes Exams</li>
          <li>Classic digital Assessments</li>
          <li>Pools</li>
          <li>Live Session (todo)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>Additionnal treatment modules (todo)</h2> 
        <p>The flexibility of the platform makes it easy to add some modules for automatic treatments of the data : </p>
        <ul class="aboutUl">
          <li>Automatic report</li>
          <li>Automatic feedback report for students</li>
          <li>Automatic test analysis</li>
          <li>Passing results to human correction</li>
          <li>Passing results to AI correction</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Some other notes</h2>
        <p>This project is developped by Jean-Philippe Rivi√®re from Wiquid. </p>
        <p>It is based on nodejs server, no framework, it is fast and solid.</p>
        <p>It will be open source + fully free version for public schools</p>

      <h2>Technical notes</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          <b>WTest-Platform</b> is a simple assessment platform, consisting of a "<B>Blogs</B>"
          page to display all tests for each student, an "<b>About</b>" page, and "<b>New Blog</b
          >" page to add new posts if the user is logged in. I created a simple
          sign up and sign in pages, and for authentication I used
          <b>JWT</b> (JSON Web Tokens). The logged in user can delete there own
          blogs individually.<br /><br />
          I used <b>Node.js</b> with
          <b>Express</b>
          framework to mange routing, requests, server-side logic and
          responses.<br />
          <i>
            You can find more information about <b>Express</b>
            <a style="color: blue" href="https://expressjs.com" target="_blank"
              >here</a
            >. </i
          ><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          To output the dynamic data that come from database I used a view
          engine
          <b> EJS </b>
        </p>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        <h4>EJS :</h4>
        <i style="color: grey"> Embedded JavaScript templating</i><br />
        <b> - How dose EJS work? </b><br />
        The view files live on the server and we want to render one through the
        browser that view file is passed into the EJS view engine to be
        processed, the engine looks for any kind of dynamic content, variables,
        loops... etc.<br />
        Then whenever it finds those it figures out the resulting HTML code for
        those parts and in the end it spits out a valid HTML page based on the
        template we wrote and then the HTML page with the resulting data inside
        it will be returned to the browser, and this whole process is called
        <b> server-side </b>rendering.<br />
        <i>

          <b> EJS </b>

      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        <h4>Database :</h4>
        I used <b>MongoDB</b> to handle data, with <b>Mongoose</b> I created a
        Schema for the blogs, it's simple, consisting of:<br />
        title, snippet and body, with a JSON object timestamps
        <i>-generated and saved automatically in the database-</i> to sort blogs
        by creation date.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div>
        <h4>MVC :</h4>
        approach It stands for <b>Model</b>, <b>View</b>, <b>Controller</b>.
        It's a method of structuring the code and files to make the code more
        modular, reusable and easier to maintain.<br /><br />
        <b>Models</b> are how to describe the data structure and use them to
        interact with the database.<br />
        <b>Views</b> are how to make HTML templates that the a user will see.<br />
        <b>Controllers</b> is the thing that forms the link between models and
        views, it use models to get data and then pass that data into a view.<br />
        The idea behinde this approach is to make the code easier to manage and
        to undestand, so I splitted the code into different areas of files and
        then each area of file has its own job to do, so the route file matches
        incoming requests and it passes those requests to the correct controller
        function. A controller communicates with the appropriate model to get
        dtat into a view, then the view renders that data into it's template and
        it get sent to the browser.

        <h4>Authentication and validation :</h4>
        for user registration, login and proper data entry verification process
        I used:<br /><br />
        <b>- JWT</b><br />
        <i>JSON Web Token</i> is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a
        compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information
        between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and
        trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a
        secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA
        or ECDSA.<br />
        <i>
          You can find more information about
          <b> JWT </b>
          <a style="color: blue" href="https://jwt.io/">here</a>. </i
        ><br /><br />
        <b>- Validator:</b><br />
        It is a third-party validation package, this package has different
        functions inside it that we can use to validate differnt things and one
        of those things is to validate an E-mail. I used "<i>isEmail</i> "
        instead of creating my own function to validate the E-mail.<br />

          <b> Validator </b>

      <div>
        <h4>Installation :</h4>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Go to the project repository on <b>Github</b> from
            <a
              style="color: blue"
              href="https://github.com/alanmiste/My-Blog"
              target="_blank"
              >here</a
            >.
          </li>
          <li>Clone the project or download it.</li>
          <li>Run <b>npm install</b> in project folder.</li>
          <li>
            The app needs to connect to <b>mongodb</b> database via
            <b>MongoDB URI</b> in the <b>.env</b> file.
          </li>
          <li>Create a database named <b>AMBlog</b> if needed.</li>
          <li>Run the project with <b>node app.js</b>.</li>
          <li>
            The App will run on
            <a style="color: blue" href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank"
              >http://localhost:3000</a
            >
            in the browser.
          </li>
